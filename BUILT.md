## 🔐 Auth Flow (Clerk)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Root provider | ✅ | ClerkProvider wraps app |
| Auth guards | ✅ | SignedIn/SignedOut components |
| Dashboard protection | ✅ | Redirects to sign-in |
| User button | ✅ | In sidebar |
| Webhook scaffold | ✅ | User sync ready |
| Organization support | ✅ | Multi-tenant ready |

**Test**: Sign up → See dashboard → User button works

---

## 🛡️ RBAC System

| Component | Status | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Permission model | ✅ | 5 resources × 3 levels |
| Middleware | ✅ | `withRBAC()` function |
| getCurrentUser | ✅ | Clerk JWT → User |
| checkPermission | ✅ | Org + Role validation |
| Org CRUD | ✅ | Create org with admin role |
| Default roles | ✅ | Admin role on org creation |

**Permission Format**: `"resource:level"` (e.g., `"docks:full"`)

**Resources**: projects, resources, docks, operations, settings  
**Levels**: none, read, full

---

## 🎨 Routes (All Scaffolded)

### Public Routes
- ✅ `/` - Landing page (beautiful, with branding)

### Dashboard Routes (Auth Required)
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Home with stats
- ✅ `/dashboard/docks` - Dock management (labeled)
- ✅ `/dashboard/projects` - Project management (labeled)
- ✅ `/dashboard/infrastructure` - Resource views (labeled)

### Settings Routes
- ✅ `/dashboard/settings` - Settings hub
- ✅ `/dashboard/settings/organization` - Org details
- ✅ `/dashboard/settings/teams` - Team management (labeled)
- ✅ `/dashboard/settings/clients` - Client management (labeled)
- ✅ `/dashboard/settings/roles` - RBAC config (labeled)

**All routes have**:
- Navigation working
- Layouts correct
- Labels clear ("Under Construction")
- Feature descriptions
- Planned functionality listed

---

## 🔧 Convex Backend

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `schema.ts` | Universal data model | ✅ |
| `lib/rbac.ts` | RBAC middleware | ✅ |
| `users.ts` | User sync from Clerk | ✅ |
| `organizations.ts` | Org CRUD | ✅ |
| `auth.config.ts` | Clerk integration | ✅ |

**Functions**:
- `getCurrentUser()` - Get authenticated user
- `checkPermission()` - Verify permissions
- `withRBAC()` - Mutation middleware
- `syncFromClerk()` - User webhook handler
- `create()` - Organization creation
- `list()` - User's organizations

---

## 🎯 What You Can Demo

### 1. Landing Page
- Beautiful hero section
- "Infrastructure's WordPress Moment" tagline
- 3 feature cards (Docks, UI, Platform registries)
- Call-to-action buttons

### 2. Auth Flow
- Click "Get Started"
- Sign up with Clerk (email or OAuth)
- Automatic redirect to dashboard

### 3. Dashboard
- Sidebar navigation (clean design)
- User button (Clerk profile)
- Stats cards (zeros for now - labeled)
- Getting started checklist

### 4. Navigation
- Click through all routes
- All working, all labeled
- Settings shows RBAC structure

### 5. Documentation
- Open ARCHITECTURE.md
- Show universal table design
- Explain dock adapter pattern

---

## 🚫 Intentionally Not Built

### Encryption System
- ❌ `convex/lib/encryption.ts` (not implemented)
- ❌ API key storage (requires encryption)
- ❌ Dock connection flow (requires encryption)

**Why**: You said stop before encryption. Auth + roles first.

### Dock Adapters
- ❌ GridPane adapter
- ❌ Vercel adapter
- ❌ Resource syncing

**Why**: Requires encryption system first.

### Full RBAC UI
- ❌ Role creation form
- ❌ Team management interface
- ❌ Client portal implementation

**Why**: Scaffolded for demo, full implementation next phase.

## 🎬 Demo Script for Wednesday

### Opening (2 min)
> "I want to show you something that doesn't exist yet - infrastructure's WordPress moment."

### Show Landing Page (1 min)
> "StackDock is a multi-cloud management platform, but it's different. See these three registries? This is the breakthrough."

### Explain Architecture (3 min)
> "Most tools create a `gridpaneSites` table. We don't. We have ONE `webServices` table. GridPane, Vercel, Railway - they all go in the same table. The dock adapter is just a translator."

> "Open ARCHITECTURE.md - 23,000 words. Every decision documented. This isn't a weekend hack. This is infrastructure for the next decade."

### Show Dashboard (2 min)
> "Here's the dashboard. Everything is scaffolded with labels. We're building this right - architecture first, no shortcuts."

### Show Settings/RBAC (2 min)
> "This is the RBAC system. Unlimited users, granular permissions, team and client scoping. Perfect for agencies managing client infrastructure."

### The Ask (2 min)
> "I need API access to build the GridPane adapter. With that, I can have your servers and sites syncing into StackDock in 48 hours."

> "Would GridPane be interested in being a launch partner? Featured in the Docks Registry, co-marketing, early access for your customers?"

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (After Demo)

### Phase 3: Encryption
1. Implement `convex/lib/encryption.ts`
2. AES-256-GCM with master key
3. Test encrypt/decrypt cycle
4. Add key rotation support

### Phase 4: GridPane Adapter
1. Create `packages/docks/gridpane/`
2. Build API client (rate limiting)
3. Implement adapter (sites → webServices, servers → servers)
4. Sync orchestration
5. Real-time status updates

### Phase 5: Resource Dashboard
1. Infrastructure views with real data
2. Filtering by provider
3. Search functionality
4. Real-time sync status

### Phase 6: Project Linking
1. Project creation UI
2. Resource linking (polymorphic)
3. Project dashboard
4. Team/client scoping
