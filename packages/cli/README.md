# StackDock CLI

> **Command-line tool for managing StackDock components and adapters**

The StackDock CLI allows you to install components and adapters from the registry into your codebase, following the copy/paste/own model.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @stackdock/cli
# or
npx @stackdock/cli

## Commands

### `stackdock add <component>`

Install a component or adapter from the registry.

```bash
# Install a UI component
npx stackdock add server-health-widget

# Install a dock adapter
npx stackdock add gridpane
```

**What it does:**
- Copies component/adapter files to your codebase
- Updates registry manifests
- Installs dependencies if needed
- You own the code - modify as needed

### `stackdock list`

List available components and adapters.

```bash
# List UI components
npx stackdock list components

# List dock adapters
npx stackdock list adapters

# List everything
npx stackdock list
```

### `stackdock init`

npx stackdock init
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `.stackdock/` directory
