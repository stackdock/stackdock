## Next: Test Dev Server

**Dev server is starting** (background process).

**Look for**:
```
✓ routeTree.gen.ts generated
➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

**If you see that**: Open browser, test auth flow.

**If you see errors**: Check terminal output and we'll diagnose.

**Structure is clean. Docs are organized. Packages are correct. Ready to test.**
