## The Vision

**Remember how shadcn/ui changed UI development?**

```bash
npx shadcn add button
# → Copies component into YOUR codebase
# → You own the code
# → No vendor lock-in
```

**StackDock does the same for infrastructure.**

```bash
npx stackdock add cloudflare
# → Copies StackDock's latest dock code into YOUR codebase
# → You own the dock adapter
# → Customize, publish your own adapters/registrys
```

### Why This Matters

- **WordPress democratized content management**
- **StackDock democratizes infrastructure management**
- **True FOSS**: You own the code (docks, UI, everything)
- **Composable**: Build your OWN infinitely customizable infra helm
- **Extensible**: If it has an API, it can be a dock

---

## Welcome Aboard Captain! ⚓️

You're early – but welcome to the shipyard! The blueprints are evolving, the vision is locked in, and we're building in public.

**This isn't just another tool.** It's infrastructure's Democracy moment.

**IMPORTANT: StackDock is currently in READ-ONLY mode. All functionality is view-only. No write operations (create, modify, delete, provision) are available or implemented.**

Star the repo to watch the build! 

---

## ⚠️ PRE-ALPHA WARNING ⚠️

**This is pre-alpha software. NOT ready for production.**

- Breaking changes frequent
- Core features under development
- Database schema evolving
- DO NOT use with critical infrastructure

**For early contributors only.** Star for updates on stable releases.

---

## 🔒 READ-ONLY MODE ⚠️

**IMPORTANT: All current functionality is READ-ONLY.**

**What this means:**
- ✅ **You CAN**: View resources, sync data, browse dashboards, read information
- ❌ **You CANNOT**: Create, modify, delete, or provision resources
- ❌ **You CANNOT**: Make changes to infrastructure through StackDock
- ❌ **You CANNOT**: Perform write operations on any provider resources

**Current Status:**
- All provider integrations are **read-only** (viewing/syncing only)
- All resource tables display **read-only** data
- All dashboards show **read-only** information
- No provisioning, modification, or deletion capabilities exist

**This is intentional.** StackDock is currently in **read-only observability mode** to validate the universal schema and translation layer before adding write capabilities.

**When will write operations be available?**
- After MVP validation is complete
- After universal schema is fully validated across all planned provider types
- Write operations will be clearly marked and documented when available

**⚠️ DO NOT attempt to use StackDock for any write operations. They are not implemented and will not work.**

---

## 🧭 Vision & Architecture

### The Three Registries

1. **Docks Registry**: Infrastructure adapters (copy/paste/own)
   - Location: `packages/docks/`
   - Coolify, Vercel, Netlify, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, GridPane etc.
   - StackDock Open Source built and official adapters "docks"
   - Translates provider APIs to StackDock's universal schema
   - See: [packages/docks/README.md](./packages/docks/README.md)

2. **UI Registry**: Dashboard components (shadcn/ui model)
   - Location: `packages/ui/`
   - Server health widgets, deployment timelines, etc.
   - Works with ANY provider (provider-agnostic)
   - Copy, customize, own
   - See: [packages/ui/README.md](./packages/ui/README.md)

3. **The Platform**: Orchestration layer
   - Universal data model and schema (`convex/schema.ts`)
   - RBAC enforcement (unlimited users)
   - Encryption & security (AES-256-GCM)
   - Audit logging
   - Real-time sync
   - CLI tool (`packages/cli/`) for registry management

### Core Architecture

**Universal Tables** (Provider-Agnostic):
- `servers`: Coolify, Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, GridPane → ONE table (Laravel Forge, Ploi etc. next)
- `webServices`: Coolify, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare → ONE table (Railway, Render, Laravel Forge, Ploi etc. next)
- `domains`: Cloudflare, GridPane, DNS Records → ONE table (DNSimple, DNS Made Easy, NameCheap, Laravel Forge, Ploi, Name.com etc. next)
- `databases`: Turso, Neon, Convex, PlanetScale → ONE table (Supabase, Xata, Pocketbase, )

**Dock Adapters** (Translators):
- GridPane API → Universal `webServices` table
- Vercel API → Universal `webServices` table
- Provider-specific data in `fullApiData` field
- Runtime adapters: `convex/docks/adapters/` (execution)
- Registry adapters: `packages/docks/` (copy/paste/own)

**AWS GCP Azure and Oracle are the "Big Four" - Obviously they will be on the road map and integrated. Just the least priority. This is a feature! Not a bug**

**See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete details.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, npm 9+

```bash
# Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/stackdock/stackdock.git
cd stackdock
npm install

# Setup environment
node scripts/generate-encryption-key.js
# Create apps/web/.env.local with your Convex + Clerk values (see below)
# Paste the generated ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY into apps/web/.env.local

# Start Convex (terminal 1)
npm run dev:convex

# Start app (terminal 2)
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

Create `apps/web/.env.local` with values like:

```
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://<your-deployment>.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:<your-deployment>
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=<64-char-hex-from-generator>

## 🔧 How It Works (For Developers)

### The Architecture

**StackDock is infrastructure's WordPress moment** - a composable platform where you own the code.

**Three Registries Model**:
1. **Docks Registry** (`packages/docks/`) - Infrastructure adapters (copy/paste/own)
2. **UI Registry** (`packages/ui/`) - Dashboard components (shadcn/ui model)
3. **The Platform** (`convex/`, `apps/web/`) - Orchestration layer (RBAC, encryption, audit)

### Universal Table Pattern

**Key Innovation**: One table per resource type, not one per provider.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Universal table
webServices: {
  provider: "gridpane" | "vercel" | "railway",
  name: string,
  productionUrl: string,
  status: string,
  fullApiData: any  // Provider-specific data preserved
}

// ❌ WRONG: Provider-specific tables
gridPaneSites: { ... }
vercelDeployments: { ... }
```

**Why This Works**:
- Unified dashboard works with ANY provider
- Cross-provider operations possible
- Scales infinitely (100 providers = 4 tables, not 100)
- UI components are provider-agnostic

### How It Works

**1. Connect Provider (Create Dock)** ✅:
```
User → Enters API key/token → System validates → Encrypts → Stores in docks table
```
*13 providers supported: GridPane, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Turso, Neon, Convex, PlanetScale, Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, Coolify*

**2. Sync Resources** ✅:
```
User clicks "Sync" → Adapter decrypts API key → Calls provider API → 
Translates to universal schema → Inserts into universal tables
```
*All providers syncing successfully, displaying in unified tables*

**3. View Unified Dashboard** ✅:
```
Dashboard queries universal tables → Shows resources from ALL providers → 
Provider-agnostic UI components render everything
```
*6 universal tables displaying real-time data via Convex queries*

**4. Provision Infrastructure** (Ready):
```
User fills form → System calls provisionResource mutation → 
Uses SST core engine OR dock adapter → Creates resource → 
Real-time status updates via Convex subscriptions
```
*Infrastructure ready, testing with GridPane*

### Current State

**✅ What's Working**:
- Core platform (auth, RBAC, encryption, audit)
- 13 providers integrated and syncing
- Universal schema validated across multiple provider types
- Resource tables displaying real-time data from all providers
- UI foundation fully functional (TanStack Table components)
- Real-time sync (Convex subscriptions)
- Provider-agnostic UI (badges, tables, sheets)

**🎯 Current Focus**:
- Linear + GitHub + Sentry adapters (Projects & Monitoring providers) - **NEXT**
- Complex auth IaaS providers (AWS/GCP/Azure) - After Projects & Monitoring
- Insights board (data visualization)
- See [`stand-downs/working/MISSION-STATUS.md`](./stand-downs/working/MISSION-STATUS.md) for current mission status

**🚀 What You Can Do Now** (READ-ONLY):
- Connect 13 providers with encrypted API keys ✅ (read-only)
- Sync resources from all providers ✅ (read-only sync)
- View unified dashboard with all resources ✅ (read-only viewing)
- See real-time updates across all providers ✅ (read-only subscriptions)
- Add more provider adapters (AWS, GCP, Azure, Sentry, etc.) (read-only adapters)

**⚠️ What You CANNOT Do**:
- ❌ Create, modify, or delete any resources
- ❌ Provision infrastructure
- ❌ Make changes to provider resources
- ❌ Perform any write operations

**📋 Next Milestone**: Solo Developer MVP
- Projects & Monitoring providers (Linear + GitHub + Sentry)
- Complex auth providers (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Insights board (data visualization)
