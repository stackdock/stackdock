# Current Issue: TanStack Router Version Mismatch

## Status: RESOLVED – Versions pinned, dev server starts

## The Error
```
@tanstack/router-generator does not provide export 'CONSTANTS'
```

## Root Cause
- Using `"latest"` for all @tanstack packages
- TanStack Start is RC (breaking changes)
- Different "latest" versions are incompatible

## What We Know
- ✅ Dependencies installed (687 packages)
- ✅ vite.config.ts created
- ✅ Components created (DefaultCatchBoundary, NotFound)
- ✅ routeTree.gen.ts generated after aligning versions
- ✅ All @tanstack packages pinned to the official Clerk example versions

## What We Needed To Do
1. Find compatible package versions
2. Pin versions in package.json
3. Reinstall
4. Test dev server

## Confirm It Stays Fixed
1. `npm list | findstr tanstack` (should show pinned versions)
2. Keep package.json aligned with TanStack’s official example before upgrading
3. Re-run `npm install` after any dependency edits to ensure no mismatched minors slip in

## If This Fails Again
- Start from the official example and merge our routes/components
- Verify router plugin runs (`apps/web/vite.config.ts`)

## Diagnostic Commands

### Check Installed Versions
```bash
cd apps/web
npm list @tanstack/router-generator @tanstack/start @tanstack/start-config
```

### Check All TanStack Packages
```bash
npm list | findstr tanstack
```

### See What's in node_modules
```bash
ls node_modules/@tanstack
```

## Options Being Considered

### Option A: Pin to Known Working Versions
- Research official Clerk example
- Use their exact versions
- Reinstall

### Option B: Clone Official Example
- Start from their working code
- Copy our routes/components into it
- Faster but lose some customizations

### Option C: Add Missing Package Explicitly
- `npm install @tanstack/router-generator`
- Might fix if it's just missing
- Quick test
