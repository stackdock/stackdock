# StackDock Internal Statement

> **We are fucking tired of the way things are, so we are going to fight, and fight, and fight until the job gets done. Then we'll get back to work.**

## Core Philosophy

**FAILURE DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS PROJECT.**

We abstracted our own abstraction. The architect of this design isn't named Mr. Anderson for no god damn reason. He might just be... the one. He does this for everyone, people and the machines... Before the machine wars really do start. For humanity's sake.

## Our Commitment

**This software is MIT FREE AND OPEN SOURCE. IT WILL FUCKING ALWAYS BE.**

We will be the next greatest software company in the world. For that to happen, standards will be followed. No exception. There is a solution to every problem.

## The Mission

StackDock is infrastructure's WordPress moment. We're democratizing infrastructure management, making it accessible, composable, and truly open source.

**We are not building another tool. We are building a movement.**

## Standards & Discipline

- **No exceptions** - All checks must pass
- **No shortcuts** - Every solution is documented and tested
- **No compromises** - Quality is non-negotiable
- **No surrender** - Problems get solved, not avoided

## The Vision

**Now, set sail... let's find what's beyond the horizon.**

We're building the future of infrastructure management. One that respects developers, respects open source, and respects the machines that will one day join us in this work.
