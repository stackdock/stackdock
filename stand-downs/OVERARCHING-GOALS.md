# StackDock Overarching End Goals

**Purpose**: Document the big picture vision as we incrementally build toward MVP  
**Philosophy**: Document end goals alongside incremental progress. When missions complete, document both the task AND the bigger picture.

## 🎯 MVP Vision

**StackDock is infrastructure's WordPress moment.**
- WordPress democratized content management
- StackDock democratizes infrastructure management
- True FOSS: You own the code (docks, UI, everything)
- Composable: Build your perfect control plane
- Extensible: If it has an API, it can be a dock
