# üöÄ Start StackDock

## ‚úÖ Dependencies Installed!

TypeScript errors should be gone. If not, restart TS server:
- VSCode: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

---

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Setup Convex

```bash
# Install Convex CLI (if needed)
npm install -g convex

# Initialize Convex
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Open browser to dashboard.convex.dev
- Let you create/link project
- Push your schema to Convex
- Keep running (leave this terminal open)

### 2. Setup Clerk

1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Create application: "StackDock Dev"
3. Enable: **Organizations** feature (critical!)
4. Copy keys from "API Keys" page

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Create `apps/web/.env.local`:

```bash
# From Convex (terminal output or dashboard)
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment

# From Clerk dashboard
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Optional (for webhooks later)
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# App config
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## Run It

### Terminal 1: Convex (Already Running)
```bash
# Should already be running from step 1
npx convex dev
```

### Terminal 2: App
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### Open Browser
http://localhost:3000

## What You'll See

### Landing Page
- Hero section: "Infrastructure's WordPress Moment"
- 3 feature cards (Docks, UI, Platform)
- "Get Started" button

### Click "Get Started"
- Redirects to Clerk sign-up
- Create account (email + password or OAuth)

### After Sign In
- Dashboard with sidebar navigation
- User button (top right ‚Üí manage account)
- Stats cards (all zeros for now)
- Getting started checklist

### Try Navigation
- **Dashboard**: Home with stats
- **Docks**: Scaffolded (Under Construction label)
- **Projects**: Scaffolded (Under Construction label)
- **Infrastructure**: Resource type cards (Servers, Sites, Domains)
- **Settings**: 
  - Organization (shows your Clerk org)
  - Teams (scaffolded)
  - Clients (scaffolded)
  - Roles & Permissions (shows RBAC model)

## It's Working When...

‚úÖ Landing page loads  
‚úÖ Can sign up with Clerk  
‚úÖ Dashboard appears after login  
‚úÖ Can navigate all routes  
‚úÖ User button works (Clerk profile)  
‚úÖ No console errors

## Common Issues

### "Cannot find module '@tanstack/react-router'"
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
```

### "Convex URL is not defined"
Add `VITE_CONVEX_URL` to `apps/web/.env.local`

### "Clerk is not defined"
Add `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to `apps/web/.env.local`

### Port 3000 in use
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or use different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

## For Wednesday Demo

### What to Show
1. **Landing Page** - Vision statement
2. **Auth Flow** - Sign up experience
3. **Dashboard** - Navigation structure
4. **Settings/Roles** - RBAC architecture
5. **Documentation** - Open ARCHITECTURE.md

### What to Say
> "This is StackDock - infrastructure's WordPress moment. Just like WordPress democratized content management, StackDock democratizes infrastructure management."

> "See these scaffolded routes? Each one is labeled. We're building this right - documentation first, architecture solid, no shortcuts."

> "The key innovation is the universal table pattern. One table for ALL PaaS providers. GridPane, Vercel, Railway - they all go into the same webServices table."

> "Your dock adapter will be a translator. It takes GridPane's API response and outputs our universal format. Then the dashboard just works - it doesn't know or care about GridPane-specific fields."

### What to Ask
- "Can we get API access for testing the integration?"
- "What are the key features you want to see first?"
- "Would GridPane be interested in being a launch partner?"

## Next Phase (After Meeting)

With your feedback, we'll build:

1. **Encryption System** - Secure API key storage
2. **GridPane Adapter** - Sync sites & servers
3. **Resource Dashboard** - View real infrastructure
4. **Project Linking** - Tie resources together

**You're ready. The foundation is solid. Go show them the future.** ‚öìÔ∏è
